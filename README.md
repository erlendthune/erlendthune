# Erlend Thune

You can read more about me on my [linkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/erlendthune/). 

I use [another profile](https://github.com/etsikt) for my professional projects.

Below is a description of some of the private projects I have made.

# IOS apps

You can install my apps from [my profile on IOS app store](https://apps.apple.com/no/developer/erlend-thune/id673691109).

[Cheese heaven](https://github.com/erlendthune/xcode-cheeseheaven) is an app where I learnt how to use the new sprite kit in Xcode. Help the mouse jump
over the perils and escape from the deep caves. If you manage to do this you will rejoin your friend in cheese heaven! 

[Corrate](https://github.com/erlendthune/xcode-corrate) connects to your bluetooth heart rate device and tells you what your pulse is with sound as often as you like. 
I made this app inspired by six-time Ironman Mark Allen and [what he wrote]( http://www.triathlontrainingarticles.com/Base.html) about heart rate training:

"You can either try to race with an engine the size of a lawnmower, or you can build your engine up with a good base so that you are racing 
with a huge-turbo charged jet engine." 

The app has an [accompanying facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/HeartRateTraining) where I've collected some articles about heart rate training.

[Polpriser](https://github.com/erlendthune/xcode-polpriser) contains a sqlite3 database with all the products and prices in the Norwegian vinmonopolet.
I made it back in the times when GSM data was costly and you wanted to check the prices on wine etc. in tax free shops to see if they were a bargain.
To create the database, I made [ruby scripts](https://github.com/erlendthune/polpriser) to scan vinmonopolets web pages. Vinmonopolet has later
provided an API to access their products, but I've found that the API does not contain all the products.
